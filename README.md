# Eat-Da-Burger!

### Description

Eat-Da-Burger is an app that saves a user's list of burgers that they'd like to try. The user can then click the "Devour!" button to save it to the list of burgers they've tried. 

### How it works

Eat-Da-Burger runs on a Node server and handles requests with Express. When the server recieves a request to add, update, or remove a burger, the data is updated in the MySQL database.
